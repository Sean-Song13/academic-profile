The core loop of this game is inspired by Monument Valley. We created the levels with new mechanisms and different themes. We calculated a specific orthographic camera angle and created scripts to achieve the smooth movement effect.

I was in charge of the opening scene, level choosing stage, and all the elements in the sci-fi stages. My partner Jianchi Zhou designed the Japanese-style scenes.
